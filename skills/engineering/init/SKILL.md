# Init

Prepare the repo for engineering work.

## 1. Check setup

Look for these markers:

- `AGENTS.md` at the repo root
- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`
- `docs/agents/domain.md`
- `CONTEXT.md` or `CONTEXT-MAP.md`

If any are missing, tell the user to run `/setup-engineering-skills` first. This skill cannot run it for you because both are user-invoked.

## 2. Map the project

If setup is in place, spawn a subagent to explore the repo and return a compact summary:

- **Structure**: top-level directories, entry points, main modules, build/test commands.
- **Tech stack**: languages, frameworks, package manager, database, deployment signals.
- **Domain language**: existing terms in `CONTEXT.md`/glossary; note any gaps or contradictions.
- **Open work**: open tickets/specs in the issue tracker; recent commits; any in-progress branches or PRs.
- **Risks**: missing tests, unclear seams, large files, heavy dependencies, anything that looks like it would slow work down.

The subagent should read only what it needs; do not dump every file.

## 3. Present the summary

Report back in a short, scannable form. Do not change any files in the repo.

```
Repo: {name}
Stack: {brief}
Entry points: {list}
Domain terms: {list or "none yet"}
Open work: {count + links, or "none"}
Risks: {list or "none obvious"}
Next: {suggested next step}
```

End with a suggested next step. If there is open work, ask whether to pick one up. If not, ask what the user wants to build.
